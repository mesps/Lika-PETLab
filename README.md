# PETLab 2019 (Lika)
Program implemented in one month for LIKA - UFPE. 
It's a program that simulates a robot army (four robots) covering an unknown environment and creating a heatmap about it. Theoretically the robots have sensors that will return a percentage of a substance (alcohol) in an environment, and then it creates a heatmap with these percentages. 

##Implemented by:

- Alexandre Burle (aqb)

- Maria Eduarda dos Santos (mesps)
